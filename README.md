  8. npm install @mui/material axios
  9. npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors body-parser dotenv axios
  10. npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
After Installing all this dependency
  1. Open the terminal(path where the project is stored)
  2. Move to backend (cd backend)
  3. Run this Command (node server.js)
  4. To Run the frontend Open the terminal(path where the project is stored You should see package.js)
  5. Run the Command (npm start)

After performing this step, the App should work Properly
Ensure that  MongoDB installed locally or have access to a MongoDB cloud instance. 
Also Ensure that MongoDB connection is mongodb://localhost:27017/medicationDB
The server will start in port 5000
The React will start in port 3000

Output Should be Visible in port http://localhost:3000
