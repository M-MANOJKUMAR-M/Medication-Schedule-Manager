## 2. Technology Stack:

### Frontend:
- **React**: Used for the web application.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between the frontend and backend, used for user authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords to secure user authentication.
- **Push Notifications**: Libraries or services such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to handle push notifications.

### Databases:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data, medications, schedules, and history.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straight-forward way to interact with MongoDB.

## 3. Prerequisite

Ensure that the following are installed:
1. **Node.js**
2. **MongoDB**
3. **VS Code**

---

## 4. How to run this:

1. Create a folder named `medication_schedule_manager`. Move to this folder and either pull or download the repository under that folder.
2. Install Express and Mongoose:  
   `npm install express mongoose`
3. Install Axios:  
   `npm install axios`
4. Install React-Select:  
   `npm install react-select`
5. Install Material-UI:  
   `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`
6. Install all dependencies (Axios, Material-UI, React-Select, etc.):  
   `npm install axios @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-select`
7. Install CORS:  
   `npm install express cors`
8. Install additional dependencies:  
   `npm install @mui/material axios`
9. Install server dependencies:  
   `npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors body-parser dotenv axios`
10. Install Babel plugin (for private property support):  
    `npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object`
###If you want to install all dependency simple run the Command
`npm install`

---

### After Installing all dependencies:

1. Open the terminal (path where the project is stored).
2. Navigate to the backend folder:  
   `cd backend`
3. Run the backend server:  
   `node server.js`
4. To run the frontend, open the terminal (path where the project is stored and you should see `package.json`).
5. Run the frontend:  
   `npm start`

---

### Ensure the following:

- MongoDB is installed locally or you have access to a MongoDB cloud instance.
- MongoDB connection is set to `mongodb://localhost:27017/medicationDB`.
- The server will start on port **5000**.
- The React app will start on port **3000**.
- The output should be visible at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
