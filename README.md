- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between the frontend and backend, used for user authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords to secure user authentication.
- **Push Notifications**: Libraries or services such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to handle push notifications.

### Databases:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data, medications, schedules, and history.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straight-forward way to interact with MongoDB.

### After Installing all dependencies:

1. Open the terminal (path where the project is stored).
2. Navigate to the backend folder:  
   `cd backend`
3. Run the backend server:  
   `node server.js`
4. To run the frontend, open the terminal (path where the project is stored and you should see `package.json`).
5. Run the frontend:  
   `npm start`
